# llvm-mos-Game-Utilities
A library of pre-made types and functions to help with general programming or game development. Designed for the new 6502 compiler, "LLVM-MOS".

Right now, there is a basic implementation for:
+ fixed16 struct
+ vec2fx16 struct

More to come.


# Other planned additions

* Useful utilities for interfacing with different parts of the NES (palette data, tile data, sprite data, controller?)
* Rect structs for use as colliders for objects
* Other useful functions for performing certain opertaions on bits.
* Packed Binary Coded Decimal struct for storing numbers that are mostly going to be displayed on screen (Score/Points)
* Random number generator
